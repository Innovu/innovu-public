# innovu-public

Repository for public Innovu resources

## Adding images to markdown in widgets

```
![text](link)
```

Where `text` is the text to be shown if the image cannot load for some reason, and `link` is the link to the image you want to show. For example, to show the example.png image in this repository, you would use:

```
![innovu logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Innovu/innovu-public/master/example.png)
```

and here's the output:

![innovu logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Innovu/innovu-public/master/example.png)
